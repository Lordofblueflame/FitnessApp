## Fitness App

Project on my studies that was really tring and required lots of my strengths to end it.


Application helps with caluculating calories this app was inspired by Fitatu i havn't found better name than Fitness App so it will stay like this.

## Getting Started

# Requirement Software

- Working flutter enviroment and dart compiler [Flutter/Dart](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- Android Studio [Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Python interpreter, pip, flask. To work with python flask i used Anaconda environment [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- Sqllite Browser if you want to get into database
 
# Before lunching

If you got to this point it's still not end you have to

- Prepare virtual machine in Android Studio i used "Pixel 4XL API 30"
- You may need to enable VMX in your bios if you don't have it enabled to install HAXM
- Run command in repo directory "Flutter build apk"

And because of some problems with virtual machine you may need to change api adress to your own


On cmd run command 'ipconfig -all' and search for 'IPv4 Address'

It should be something similiar to this.


I tried to select files that have to be here but this is my first flutter project and python project so there may be some changes regarding this.

# Lunch

I've made .bat file that will run this application, but you can do it on your own.


If you're using VSCode i prepared two lunch options first one lunch Flutter app second one lunch Python flask api server
